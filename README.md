# ArduinoProjects
I'm fascinated with the interplay of software and hardware, so here's all my little tests that I do!

- 4 ir sensor setup: Practicing taking 4 IR sensors input (HW-201)
- dual motor setup: Driving 2 motos with L298N driver
- forward backward irsensor: Practicing taking 2 IR sensor inputs (HW-201)
- motors w ir sensors: Motor stopping when obstacle detected by IR sensors
